Vendor Management System with Performance Metrics

This repository contains the source code for a Vendor Management System (VMS) developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework. The system enables organizations to effectively manage their vendors and analyze vendor performance metrics over time.

Key Features:

Vendor Management: Maintain a database of vendors including their contact details, address, and performance metrics such as on-time delivery rate, quality rating average, average response time, and fulfillment rate.
Purchase Order Management: Capture details of each purchase order, track order status, and calculate various performance metrics based on interactions recorded in the system.
Performance Metrics: Automatically calculate and update performance metrics including on-time delivery rate, quality rating average, average response time, and fulfillment rate using backend logic triggered by specific events such as order completion or acknowledgment.
API Endpoint Implementation: Implement RESTful API endpoints to retrieve vendor performance metrics and acknowledge purchase orders, allowing for seamless integration with other systems.
Additional Information:

The system is designed to handle large datasets efficiently and ensure data integrity by including checks for missing data points or division by zero in calculations.
Real-time updates are facilitated using Django signals to trigger metric updates when related purchase order data is modified.
This project serves as a comprehensive solution for organizations seeking to optimize vendor management processes and improve decision-making through data-driven insights.
